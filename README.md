# The-python-that-makes-everyone-mad

Make sure Python is installed, I recommend any python verson above 3.1
It should work, if it doesn't work, make sure you sucessfully installed python, and if you may, you might need to get python from its official wesite, https://www.python.org
https://www.python.org/downloads/ is where you find it btw

Feel free to edit the code to your liking and post it anywhere!
